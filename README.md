# film
a fully learned index for larger-than-memory databases



the optimal solution of generating piece-wise-linear functions has well studied by computional geometry [ref: Joseph O’Rourke. 1981. An on-line algorithm for fitting straight lines between data ranges. Commun. ACM 24, 9 (1981), 574–578.], and the PGM-Index has implemented it in C++ implementation[ref: https://github.com/gvinciguerra/PGM-index], the learned model of FILM is on the basis of the segmentation from PGM-index.
